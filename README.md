## Data Science for Fundamental Sciences

This repository includes all my practical work for the Data Analysis for Fundamental Sciences class which I participated during Spring 2024 Term at my school, Istanbul Technical University. My work is graded by the lecturer himself. The official page of the class is [here](https://github.com/kaygun/2024-Spring-388E).

### Lecturer: [Prof. Dr. Atabey Kaygun](https://web.itu.edu.tr/kaygun/)

## About the Class

The course thoroughly explored the foundational mathematical principles behind traditional statistical and machine learning models commonly used in this field. It extensively taught us to effectively implement and apply these algorithms across various practical scenarios. The practical part involved 4 mini projects with numerous tasks and a final project of our choosing. All my work can be found on this repository.
